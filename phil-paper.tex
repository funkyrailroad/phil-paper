\section{What is inclusive foreign aid?}

Inclusive foreign aid is foreign aid or development work that is aimed
primarily at advancing the status and welfare of people with disabilities
(PWDs) in underdeveloped countries, particularly the Least Developed Countries
(LDCs). LDC is a classification used by the UN which indicates a certain level
of per capita income of a country. Of the approximately 1300 million people
who survive on less than 1 USD per day, over 200 million of them have some
form of disability or impairment \citep{chowdhury2006economics}. 

The types of disability range from lifelong conditions to something caused in
an accident of some sort. Lifelong conditions can be blindness, deafness,
muteness, lame limbs, etc. Disability caused by an accident can be due to
uncleared minefields, an amputation, trauma, etc. The cause of a specific
impairment does not matter as much as the particular impairment because
solutions address the limitations imposed by the impairment as opposed to the
cause of the impairment. However, identifying causes is critical for
identifying appropriate preventative measures.

PWDs face additional difficulties when compared to their non-impaired brothers
and sisters, and for this reason additional considerations are necessary if
PWDs are to benefit from typical development aid projects.


\subsection{Recognized problems}

\paragraph{No access to health facilities}

Obstacles faced by PWDs in LDCs are numerous. Immediately after an accident
especially, but also in the case of standard medical check-ups, PWDs need
access to health facilities in order to be given proper treatment if needed.
Many health facilities are not able to accommodate PWDs. This could be in the
form of barriers to entry, which could include a lack of elevator, only stairs
outside and no ramp. However this can also mean that hospitals simply to not
have the equipment to assist or rehabilitate those with disabilities. For
example, if a hospital does not have any crutches, prosthetic legs or
wheelchairs, then that hospital is not able to help a person who just lost
their leg become more mobile. 


\paragraph{No/fewer employment opportunities}

PWDs in general have a more difficult time finding or maintaining employment.
At the very least, having a disability limits the range of possible employment
opportunities. If a person becomes disabled, the combination of their
disability and their employment will decided whether or not the person will be
able to keep their. \cite{chowdhury2006economics} observe that a shopkeeper
and farmer who sustain an injury that leads to the same disability will have
immensely different prospects depending on the disability. In the case of a
missing leg, the shopkeeper will largely be able to continue his daily work as
it is primarily sedentary, whereas the farmer will suffer far worse
consequences and likely no longer be able to continue.

\paragraph{Poor access to credit}

A further difficulty faced by PWDs in LDCs are a lack of opportunities for
credit. This is not only true for PWDs, but generally for impoverished
individuals in LDCs, however there has been a link established between poverty
and disability. This aspect is causally related to the no/fewer employment
opportunities aspect because it limits any entrepreneurial activity that might
be undertaken. The lack of legitimate credit options sets the scene for
predatory credit sharks to take advantage of those in need. Additionally,
merely the availability of access to credit does not solve the problem of the
loan shark; credit must be available to those in need, and its availability
must be made known to those in need.


\paragraph{Illiteracy}

A final obstacle faced by the world’s poor and disabled is a lack of basic
education. The reasons can be myriad. Perhaps there are no facilities nearby
that are capable of providing such education, perhaps the facilities are not
equipped such that PWDs might benefit from them, or perhaps the PWD is
mentally deficient in some respect and unable to progress in an educational
environment suited to more normally-abled people. Regardless of the reason,
the effects are the same.

\newpage
\section{The contextual distinction: discovery and justification}

This field is currently an active field, and accordingly there are various
research efforts underway generating knowledge. This then begs the question,
how is knowledge generated in this field?  


One model of knowledge generation involves a dichotomy of contexts: the
context of discovery and the context of justification. The context of
discovery involves the efforts exerted while trying to get a grasp on the
topic at hand and is often associated with the ``Eureka!'' moment. This can
involve data collection, building hypotheses and even aimless experimentation.
The context of justification on the other hand involves providing support for
a given hypothesis or theory. In other words, the efforts expended while
trying to verify whether or not the realization of the Eurkea moment is valid.
The latter is more clearly within the domain of philosophy of science; it
involves verifying if what we think is true is indeed true, which is very much
related to epistemological concern of ``How do we know what we know?''
\citep{schickore2014scientific}. Furthermore, there are two ways of
conceptualizing this division: temporally and logically
\citep{schickore2006introduction}.  Initially it was conceived as being a
temporal distinction; the context of the discovery happens first, and then the
context of justification follows. This however is too simplistic.  More
accurate is the logical distinction whereby the scientist can alternate
between the two contexts, allowing the each context to benefit from the other.

\subsection{Context of discovery}

The context of discovery is the context in which ideas and potential claims to
knowledge are generated. As inclusive foreign aid is a subfield of foreign
aid, the most obvious way to generate knowledge claims is to borrow them from
the field of foreign aid. However it is very possible (and in cases has
already been shown to be true) that some of these measures do not benefit
people with disabilities as much as people without disabilities. A shared goal
of inclusive foreign aid and foreign aid is poverty reduction, so it may at
least be conjectured that similar efforts may also help reduce poverty among
disabled populations. This at least serves as a good starting point because
although it may benefit people with disabilities less, it still does benefit
them. A solution that was first implemented in the field of foreign aid but
can also potentially benefit populations of people with disabilities is
providing microfinance opportunities.

\paragraph{Microfinance opportunities}

In line with the social model's definition of independence, another way to
give PWDs more autonomy is to give them credit or at least provide them with
credit opportunities. This credit can be seen a way to enable PWDs to make
their own decisions and be responsible for the repercussions of this. Because
PWDs in LDCs are very poor (as much of the rest of the population in LDCs),
even very small loans are able to make a large difference. Typical in the case
of an impoverished population is a self-perpetuating cycle of poverty. A poor
person doesn't have any money, so they need to borrow the supplies and the
materials to make a good which they can later sell, but they borrow the
supplies and raw materials at a price that can mean they barely break even at
the end of it.

\paragraph{The knowledge claim}

One must know the precise knowledge claim. The knowledge claim is made in
response to some unknown, the original question that prompted the research.
So we can begin by asking, what would the field of inclusive foreign aid like
to know? Or less abstractly, what would the researchers of inclusive foreign
aid like to know? They want to know how to provide foreign aid to countries in
need in a manner than allows PWDs to also benefit from these measures. Simply
put, they want to do good for PWDs. However, this isn't all. They want to do
good for PWDs \emph{efficiently}. There is a finite amount of money available
for development aid, and ideally it would be used in a manner such that the
largest number of people can benefit from it. Given two policies to choose
from policy A and policy B, there needs to be some way of choosing between the
two policies. If policy A is able to provide a service to 500 people for the
same cost that policy B is able to provide the same service to 5000 people,
clearly policy B is preferable to policy A. Thus we have established two
values of the inclusive foreign aid policy, doing good for PWDs in LDCs and
doing so efficiently. This establishes a clear backdrop against which any
knowledge claims may be evaluated. The context of justification is where this
evaluation takes place.



\subsection{Context of justification}

In the sense of inclusive foreign aid, the context of justification is
concerned with whether or not a given policy has the intended effects.
Generally the policy goals are in line with reducing poverty and suffering
amongst those with disabilities, but the means by which this is done and the
intermediate goals range from policy to policy. Absolutely crucial in any
policy analysis effort is the availability and analysis of useful metrics that
at least serve as proxies for the states of interest. For example, income may
serve as a proxy for poverty. It is however only a proxy because poverty is a
multidimensional phenomenon that involve variables other than merely income
\cite{alkire2011understandings}.

Inclusive foreign aid suffers from a measurement problem and therefore has
difficulties in justifying whether or not given policies work.

As \cite{ingstad2011disability} note, 

\begin{quote}
\ldots a mapping and monitoring system is simply not in place in low-income
countries, yielding a weak knowledge base for including people with
disabilities as well as other vulnerable groups in research that can
effectively inform poverty alleviation programmes.
\end{quote}

This practical obstacle is a limitation for the context of justification, and
it shows how young of a field inclusive foreign aid is and how tentative any
of its claims of knowledge are. Currently there are only suggestions of what
works.  Many of the poverty reduction methods are assumed to be valid and
helpful also for people with disabilities, but ample data has not been
collected to either refute or confirm these claims.

There are two ways that this type of data may be obtained and interpreted: the
micro and macro perspectives \citep{ingstad2011disability}. Here is also the
contrast between the pure abstractions of the ``universal'' and the
``particular,'' as well as the hybrid ``individual'' as used by
\cite{collingwood1922history}. The micro perspective focuses on specific
perspectives and stories; the  concrete incidences and consequences of living
with a disability. The macro perspective considers studies and surveys on key
indicators for broader populations. Important for this approach are consistent
definitions that can be used across studies and ensure that apples are indeed
being compared to apples. For example, something as fundamental as the
definition of disability presents difficulties. Traditionally seen as a binary
description, either disabled or not, there are clearly different types of
disability. Even amongst similar types, there are varying degrees of
disability. The challenge is defining disability in a manner than many can
agree on while neglecting none of these aspects.

Solving the specific measuring problems and acquiring the necessary data is
needed for justifying the knowledge claim with respect to the first value of
the paradigm (doing good), but it is not sufficient to address the second value
of the paradigm (efficiency). One such methodology of doing so is by conducting
a cost-benefit analysis (CBA). Typical accounting work commonly done in a
business involves looking at expenditures and revenues to determine the
profitability of that business. CBA is a generalization of this, whereby not
only the expenditures and revenues of one business (i.e. group of stakeholders)
are considered, but rather all parties involved. Additionally, it attempts to
incorporate goods that don't typically have dollar-valued costs associated with
them. It takes a macro-level view of the situation and tries to quantify every
aspect that is involved \cite{mishan2015elements}.



\subsection{Inextricable linkage}

Kuhn argued that the context distinction is not a fundamental aspect of the
knowledge generation process. In his view, the discovery and justification
processes are not necessarily distinct from each other, and become essential
parts of the theories for which they played an important role in forming.

In inclusive foreign aid, one can clearly see how the values of the paradigm
are present in justification processes, and how these elements of the theory (the
values that it was answering) are integral parts of the justification process.
The justification process is not merely a part of the theory nor is the theory
merely a part of the justification, but they are inextricably linked.

\paragraph{Participatory research}
\label{part}

Participatory research is a way of gathering information from a target
population in a way that enables the target population to contribute to and
shape the knowledge gleaned from the interaction. As an example, two
anthropologists observing an indigenous tribe can sit quietly and observe many
situations without disturbing (or ``interacting with,'' to use a word with a
more neutral connotation) the objects of their observation. This methodology
is limited in that it only allows for knowledge to be generated from the
perspective/paradigm of the anthropologists, and the perspective/paradigm of
the indigenous tribe is completely ignored (or unutilized, to again use a word
with a more neutral connotation.)

Participatory research intends to incorporate this additional perspective into
the knowledge-generation process. In the above example, the anthropologists
make their observations but then would continue to engage in a dialogue with
the indigenous people. In this way, the biases introduced by the
anthropologists via their inductive generalizations are subjected to the input
and criticism of the natives. This introduction of a new viewpoint allows for
the ``averaging of viewpoints'' process that is outlined by
\cite{datson1992objectivity}. According to Datson, this process is the road to
aperspectival objectivity.  Aperspectival objectivity is objectivity which
loses the individual idiosyncrasies involved in the knowledge-generation
process, i.e. the biases and preconceived notions held by the observers.
Aperspectival objectivity has also been disparagingly dubbed ``the view from
nowhere,'' since the elimination of idiosyncrasies can be said to amount to the
elimination of the individual perspective. However, this author finds a more
fitting metaphor for aperspectival objectivity to be ``the view from
everywhere.`` The averaging process does not involve eliminating old elements,
but rather incorporating new elements (i.e.  perspectives), and for this reason
should be seen as an additive operation.  The typical mathematical operation
associated with averaging is the arithmetic mean. In this process, N different
values, which can represent anything, are all multiplied by the same fraction
1/N and then summed. In this case again, averaging is an additive process.

``averaging of viewpoints?''}

\section{Inclusive foreign aid as a transdisciplinary field}

\subsection{Transdisciplinarity explained}

The concept of transdisciplinarity is a subtopic in the field of
interdisciplinarity. To get an idea of exactly what transdisciplinarity is,
it’s helpful to have an overview of interdisciplinarity and what that means.

\paragraph{Disciplinarity and disciplines}

Interdisciplinarity stands in contrast to the standard disciplines with which
those of us in modern western universities are very familiar. To name a few,
they include classic subjects like physics, chemistry, economics, psychology,
etc. Although seemingly set in stone in the modern university, these
disciplines evolved into their current form over the course of the last 200
years. As is usual with historical processes, their evolution is not entirely
predetermined and if it were to happen again, there stands the chance that the
disciplines would have emerged in a different form. Given the arbitrariness
involved, one can wonder which other disciplines could have emerged given
certain other circumstances. One can envision a merging or fracturing of the
various modern disciplines that might be more directed at solving slightly or
potentially even substantially different problems. 

\paragraph{Multidisciplinarity and disciplines}

The first step on the way to transdisciplinarity from traditional academic
disciplines is multidisciplinarity. Multidisciplinarity involves the
perspective of multiple disciplines. In doing this, the multidisciplinary
approach provides access to more knowledge and methods than a traditional
disciplinary approach, but each discipline remains fully intact. As a result,
there is a lack of integration of the different perspectives. Words like
juxtaposing, sequencing, and coordinating fit to the multidisciplinary
approach. 

\paragraph{Interdisciplinarity and interdisciplines}

The next step is known as interdisciplinarity. The primary difference is the
degree of integration of the individual disciplinary perspectives that is
achieved. Words like interacting, integrating, focusing, blending, and linking
aptly describe this approach. An interdisciplinary approach can be the result
of borrowing the methods of a different discipline, although the degree to
which this impacts the borrowing discipline can vary. A stronger or more
``genuine'' form of interdisciplinarity can be the result of theoretical
integration. In this sense of interdisciplinarity, one overarching theoretical
framework can offer insight into multiple disciplines, and findings in one
discipline can contribute to the problems and theories of another.

\paragraph{Transdisciplinarity and transdisciplines}

Finally we arrive at transdisciplinarity. Transdisciplinarity, in the sense
relevant to this work, focuses on the generation of knowledge directed at
solving real-world problems. This amounts to letting the real-world and its
inhabitants dictate which problems are important and in need of solving as
opposed to the traditional academic disciplinary structures. Because of the
potential divergence between the needs of a specific real-world problem and
the specialization of a traditional discipline, it is possible that the
knowledge and methods needed to address a given real-world problem are spread
across different disciplines. This is a similar concept to interdisciplinarity
as explained above, with the additional condition that external (to academia)
stakeholders also contribute to the knowledge generation process. As a result,
transdisciplinarity can be thought of as interdisciplinarity with societal
input. 

\paragraph{An instructive example}

\cite{latour1999circulating} details an expedition in which a botanist,
pedologist and geomorphologist investigate the boundary between a forest and
savannah. They wish to determine they dynamics at the interface; is the forest
or savannah advancing, or perhaps neither? Upon first glance, the botanist's
analysis leads to the conclusion that forest could either be advancing or
receding, and the pedologist's analysis leads to the conclusion that the
savannah is advancing.  Merely comparing the two conclusions from the two
disciplines amounts to a multidisciplinary approach. However, their
contrasting conclusions are the reason for further investigation.

While the botanist and pedologist are taking measurements and discussing the
significance of the results, the geomorphologist ``adds her two cents to all
the conversations, allowing her expatriate colleagues to 'triangulate' their
judgments through hers'' \citep{latour1999circulating}. This exchange is
exemplary of an interdisciplinary approach. There are three disciplines
present, and each is interacting with  and integrating the viewpoints of the
others. It differs from the multidisciplinary approach in that there is an
exchange between the individual disciplinary standpoints.

In order to see transdisciplinarity in action, there would have to be input
from external stakeholders. Latour mentions the significance that findings of
this investigation might have for businessmen (external stakeholders), but
this is not enough. In order to display transdisciplinarity, the businessmen
need to play a role in the knowledge generation process; their interest is not
enough, their input is necessary.




\subsection{Inclusive foreign aid as a transdisciplinary field}

Inclusive foreign aid is a transdisciplinary field because it both addresses a
societally relevant problem with the input of stakeholders and integrates
findings and methodologies from various disciplines.

\paragraph{Extra-academic genesis of the problem / Problem framing /
Stakeholder Input}

The genesis of this problem clearly does not lie in any of the traditional
disciplines. The entire concept of foreign aid is focused on solving
real-world problems. The issue of who exactly are the stakeholders is however
an interesting one. The advances in disability studies in the USA make it
clear that the stakeholders should be the ones affected by the suggested
policies and solutions with the mantra ``Nothing about us, without us.''

The stakeholders in any endeavor relevant to inclusive foreign aid are the
donors, the recipients, and the people that implement the policies. In some
cases, the latter two categories are the same. Ensuring that those receiving
the aid play a role in the planning and implementation process is in line with
the slogan ``Nothing about us without us'' found in the disability studies
literature \citep{pfeiffer2000disability}. The means by which some of the
stakeholders play a role in the knowledge generation process is known as
participatory research, which is explained in \autoref{part}.

\paragraph{Which disciplines are involved and how do they interact in an
interdisciplinary manner?}

\paragraph{What types of things are drawn on from the different disciplines?}

Inclusive foreign aid includes aspects from a variety of different disciplines
including disability studies, finance, economics, law, education, technology,
medicine, psychology, sociology, bionics and engineering. 

There is however a difference between calling upon the knowledge and
methodologies of those disciplines in a merely juxtapositional manner and
doing so in a more integrative manner (i.e. multidisciplinarity or
interdisciplinarity as explained above).

Inclusive foreign aid borrows many concepts and methods from disability
studies. Some of these things include the paradigms and models of disability
and the survey methods. The issue of how to effectively conduct surveys is a
good example of borrowing a methodology from one domain and adapting it to fit
the current domain. 

Inclusive foreign aid also borrows economics concepts of poverty, inequality,
asset index and economic mobility. Viewing disability through the lens of
inequality allows one to determine the effects on economic welfare that
disability can have. For example, by measuring the asset index \footnote{An
asset index measures wealth not merely by income, but also considers basic
assets like access to basic sanitation, running water, indoor plumbing, etc.}
in different countries and across income groups, functionally limited people
were found to be two to four times more likely to be in the lowest income
quintile when compared to the highest income quintile
\citep{mitra2018disability}.  

As a final example, inclusive foreign aid borrows concepts from the field of
technology in the way of prosthetics and other assistive technologies
\cite{roulstone2016disability}. These technologies, in very simple cases, have
the potential eliminate a disability. In surveys of Ethiopia, Malawi, Tanzania
and Uganda, the most common disability for those with both severe and moderate
functional difficulties was sight-related \citep{mitra2018disability}. It was
also found that assistive technologies were largely unused due to either cost
of availability issues. Simple measures such as glasses would be sufficient to
greatly reduce the number of people who identify themselves as disabled.  This
perspective provides insight into the validity of two paradigms in inclusive
foreign aid and disability studies, which will be explained in more detail in
\autoref{models}.


\newpage
\section{Inclusive foreign aid from the perspective of various philosophers of
science}

\subsection{Kuhnian Perspective}

\subsubsection{Establishment of a Paradigm}
\label{models}

There are a number of paradigms within disability studies, and also a number
of problems that the field is oriented towards solving. The different
paradigms represent different approaches to solving these problems. The first
conceptualization of disability is known as the medical model. It views a
person with a disability in a way similar to a sick person. The disability is
viewed as a deficiency that may be potentially remedied via medical
intervention so that the person may be able to live as close to a ``normal''
life as possible. 

A second paradigm that came as a reaction to the medical model is called the
social model. It offers a social constructionist view of the situation whereby
the person with disability (in the sense of the medical model) is only
rendered  disabled by the societal conditions and norms. The social model
offers a distinction between an impairment and a disability. An impairment can
be defined as ``the condition of a person lacking part or all of limb, organ
or mechanism of the body.'' A mechanism of the body is to be understood as a
sense like hearing or sight, but can also include something more advanced like
the ability to read. Disability is then defined as ``the disadvantage or
restriction of activity caused by a contemporary social organization which
\ldots excludes [people with physical impairments] from participation in the
mainstream of social activities.'' In this sense, an impairment does not
necessitate a disability; the disability arises only if they are somehow
excluded. For example, a person without legs is clearly impaired, but the
state of their disability is defined to be context-specific. If this person is
in a building without an elevator and needs to gain access to the roof, he or
she is disabled. However, the disability disappears if there is a functioning
elevator. Conversely, with this set of definitions, it is also possible for a
person to have a disability without being impaired. An example of this is a
left-handed person who has difficulty using tools that are traditionally built
for use by a right-handed person.

An additional way of seeing the situation of a person with disability (PWD) is
to posit that they are being actively oppressed (whether intentionally or not)
by people without disabilities. In essence, that people without disabilities
are denying PWDs certain basic social rights. This is seen as an intolerable
injustice, and the question becomes what dominant beliefs and practices of the
time enable this. There are two basic premises of the social model (Winter
2003): 1) An impairment is made into a disability only by social conditions
and 2) Any policy should focus on giving the most autonomy to the impaired
person as possible.  



\subsection{Latourian perspective}


\subsubsection{Quasi-objects in Inclusive Foreign Aid}

\paragraph{What is a quasi-object}

Bruno Latour outlines the idea of a Quasi-object in his book ``We Have Never
Been Modern.'' He presents a problem with the traditional subject/society and
object/nature dichotomy. There are two faulty beliefs refuted by contradictory
denunciations when it comes to the interaction between objects and subjects. 

Belief 1: Objects have an intrinsic value, like money, gods, and status. 

Denunciation 1: Those things are intrinsically worthless and society merely
projects its values onto these objects, which are essentially blank slates.

In this view of things, the objects are weak and worthless, and society is
powerful enough to be capable of making anything out of them.

Belief 2: Subjects have free will and have the power to do whatever it is they
like.

Denunciation 2: This isn't true, there are natural constraints on subjects
that limit what they can do.  In this view of things, subjects are weak over
the influence of an overwhelmingly powerful nature.

As mentioned above, these two denunciations are incompatible. Objects are
meaningless in the first but powerful enough to decide the fate of humans in
the second, while subjects are capable of shaping the natural world according
to their whims in the first and helplessly weak in the second. Social
scientists usually address this contradiction by positing a dualism in both
the objects and subjects: objects have a hard ``pole'' that is capable of
shaping and limiting behavior of the soft pole of subjects, and also a soft
pole upon which the hard pole of culture can project its values. Said
differently, subjects have a hard pole that is capable of projecting and
giving value to the soft pole of objects, and a soft pole that is shaped and
limited by the hard pole of the objects.

The problem with this is that the list of things that make up the hard and
soft parts are somewhat arbitrary. They depend on what the social science
believes. The hard parts of nature are whatever of the natural sciences they
believe, and the hard parts of society are whatever of the social sciences
they believe. 

When social scientists deployed the same arguments that were used to debunk
the soft components of nature on the hard components of nature (the sciences
themselves that were foundational aspects of their beliefs) by seeing them as
the products of the society's interests and requirements, the whole dualistic
paradigm collapsed. Once it was deemed absurd that society constructed all of
the scientific facts out of its own self-interest, it was also seen as much
less plausible that these soft facts could just as easily be dismissed in the
same manner.

Quasi-objects are offered as the solution to the problem that not all objects
and subjects are only either indefinitely malleable or infinitely powerful. To
take a direct quote from Latour,

``Quasi-objects are much more social, much more fabricated, much more
collective than the 'hard' parts of nature, but they are in no way the
arbitrary receptacles of a full-fledged society. On the other hand they are
much more real, nonhuman and objective than those shapeless screens on which
society – for unknown reasons – needed to be 'projected'.''

The proposition that will be expanded on below is that prosthetics and other
augmentations that enable PWDs to become more ``normal'' are quasi-objects.
Additionally that this has the potential to unify two different paradigms of
disability studies. 


\paragraph{Prosthetics and etc. are Quasi-objects}

The connection between a stump leg and a quasi-object was previously made by
(Bertram 2018). The proposition relevant for this discussion is that all
prosthetics are quasi-objects. Seen through the lens of the subject/object
dichotomy, a prosthetic is clearly not a subject. It is true that a prosthetic
itself is a nonhuman, nonliving, inorganic object, but seen through the
hard/soft pole dichotomy that Latour explains, is a prosthetic on the list of
hard or soft traits? 

In one sense, it belongs to the hard side because it is able to impact the
experience of subjects. Prosthetics allow for very real changes in the lives
of PWDs. Examples include enabling leg amputees to run, the deaf to hear, the
blind to see, etc. A prosthetic is not an intrinsically meaningless object
upon which society merely projects its values because it offers value to a PWD
independent of the society and culture. Thus the first denunciation is
debunked.

In another sense, it belongs to the soft side because it is the object of
human creation. Humans have designed this to suit their needs, and further
modifications can be made to reflect advancements in technology, ergonomics,
and user satisfaction. At any rate, a prosthetic cannot be said to be an all
powerful object over which humans have no control. Thus the second
denunciation mentioned above is debunked.

Once the two denunciations have been found to not apply, i.e. that this object
is neither exclusively on the hard pole nor the soft pole,  we find ourselves
in the territory of quasi-objects.


\paragraph{seeing prosthetics as a quasi-object can merge the social and
medical/functional model}

Conceding that a prosthetic limb is a quasi-object allows for the merging of
the social and medical/functional paradigms.




\subparagraph{How were they previously viewed as incommensurable? What were
the problems that the social model has with prosthetics?}

The social model and medical model cannot be said to exist harmoniously. The
social model was formulated as a direct response to the medical model with
every intent to demolish it, and therefore it should not be a surprise that
they differ in some fundamental way. This fundamental difference is the source
of the incommensurability of the two viewpoints. As Kuhn realized, a
scientific methodology is not sufficient to uniquely determine the knowledge
that will be generated in a given scientific endeavor. The world views held by
the scientists, their ways of conceptualizing the environment in which they do
science, serve as the foundation upon which their scientific knowledge is
built. Kuhn's claim is that different foundations can lead to different
structures despite using similar tools (scientifically valid methods).

These foundational world views can be viewed as being composed of postulates.
Conflicting postulates in opposing world views are the source of the
incommensurability. By resolving conflicts between postulates, world views can
be aligned and paradigms merged. An attempt at merging the medical and social
models by addressing their fundamental assumptions will be outlined below.

The social model seeks to rid PWDs of the ``sick person'' identity. In doing
so however the sick role is not fully removed, but transferred onto the
broader society. The problem doesn’t go away, it is simply reframed; a PWD is
no longer seen as sick and unable to care for him or herself, but rather
society at large is seen as being sick and unable to care for all of its
members.

The social model argues that it is society's duty to accommodate for people
with impairments, as the current incarnation of available facilities has been
generated by able-bodied people who neglected the needs of impaired persons.
In doing this, the social model hopes to entirely reframe society's view of a
PWI. Once society has done this and built itself to no longer exclude these
people, ideally disability will be a notion of the past, and only impairments
will exist. This is done on the initiative of the larger society, does not
require labeling an impaired person as a ``sick'' person.

However, we see that even in examples given by proponents of the social model,
elements of the medical model are still assumed to be relevant.  In the
example of a person confined to a wheelchair described above used to explain
the difference between an impairment and a disability, a disability was
defined to exist only if an impaired person is somehow excluded as a result of
their impairment. To repeat, this person in a wheelchair is disabled in a
building in which there are only stairs, but not disabled if there are
accessible elevators. However, the element of the medical model that is
assumed by the social model is the wheelchair itself. In the case of a person
with no use of their limbs, this wheelchair is essential to their ability
to navigate a building at all; the elevator is not sufficient to remove the
disability. 

The social model generally views prosthetics and augmentations
unfavorably because the implication is that the person with impairment is
inadequate, favoring the alternative view that society itself is inadequate.
If one instead views prosthetics and augmentations not merely as an inanimate
object, but rather as a quasi-object that also fulfills a social role and
duty, perhaps the proponents of the social model would be more satisfied with
solutions of that form.

\subparagraph{How are they commensurable?}

\subparagraph{What practical considerations are involved too?}

cost of providing full prosthetics to everyone vs cost of building ramps
everywhere or some other more social solution

\subparagraph{Objections?}

A potential flaw in this line of argument may be that not all disabilities can
be removed with help from a prosthetic. However it is also the case that not
all disabilities can be removed via social interventions. I do concede that
prosthetics are not very helpful in the case of mental disabilities.
